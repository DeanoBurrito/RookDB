--- IN PROGRESS ---
Write functionality
Write Terminal.GUI based editor database
Terminal Editor:
-Tabbed interface showing all available tables/allowing table switching


--- FRONT BURNER ---
List printing in RookDB.PrettyPrintFieldValue
Editor -> Editing (haha) of record fields 


--- BACK BURNER ----
Editor can be launcher with args to load files directly.


--- KNOWN ISSUES ---
RookDB.PrettyPrintField -> Does not print list at all. Need to design a solution here
Editor save as window is omitting the final directory before the filename, causing save locations to be one directory up the file tree from expected.
GetField just returns the raw values. This could result in unexpected behaviour for refs/lists.

Editor.ColumnHeaderControl has no indication of extra columns to left/right of current slice.
